Welcome to my Programming Portfolio! This repository showcases my learning journey and practical work in programming through various materials including lecture notes, assignments, practicals, and projects.


# Logbook

The Logbook folder contains detailed lecture note summaries from my programming courses. These notes are written in my own words to help me understand and remember key programming concepts covered in lectures.


# Notebook

The Notebook folder contains my bi-weekly assignments and practicals. These are coding exercises and tasks that reinforce my understanding of programming concepts through hands-on practice.
- Bi-weekly assignments with problem statements and solutions
- Practicals based on lab exercises or tutorials
- Includes code files and sometimes explanations or comments

# Project

The Project folder contains my final projects which are comprehensive applications or programs that demonstrate my programming skills and ability to apply what I have learned.
