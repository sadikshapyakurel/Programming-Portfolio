# Week 5 – Scripts and Modules

## Activities I Did
- Learned how Python code is stored in program files with the `.py` extension.
- Practiced writing and executing Python scripts.
- Ran Python programs from the command line.
- Used command line arguments with `sys.argv`.
- Created and imported my own Python modules.
- Practiced different ways of importing modules and functions.
- Used aliases while importing modules.
- Learned how Python searches for modules using the module search path.
- Used the `dir()` function to explore module contents.
- Learned how the `__name__` variable works.

## Summary of Week 5 Lecture

This week focused on **Scripts and Modules in Python**, which help organize programs and reuse code.  We learned that instead of writing code only in interactive mode, Python programs can be saved in **`.py` files** and executed as scripts.We practiced running scripts from the command line and passing **command line arguments**, which are accessed using the `sys.argv` list. This allows programs to receive input values during execution.The lecture also introduced **modules**, which are Python files containing reusable functions and variables. We learned different ways to import modules, including importing the entire module, importing specific functions, and using aliases.We also studied the **module search path**, which explains how Python locates modules during import. The use of the `dir()` function helped us inspect available functions and variables inside a module.
Finally, we learned about the special variable **`__name__`**, which allows a Python file to behave differently when run as a script or imported as a module.
