# Week 7 – Sets and Dictionaries

## Activities I Completed
- Studied how sets work and how they are different from lists and tuples.
- Created sets to store unique values and observed how duplicates are removed automatically.
- Practiced common set operations such as combining sets and finding common or different elements.
- Used set comprehensions to create sets in a concise and readable way.
- Learned the difference between normal sets and immutable sets (`frozenset`).
- Used methods to add and remove elements from sets.
- Learned how dictionaries store data using key and value pairs.
- Created dictionaries using different approaches including literals and constructors.
- Added new entries, updated existing values, and deleted items from dictionaries.
- Iterated through dictionary keys, values, and key-value pairs.
- Used dictionaries in functions with keyword arguments (`**kwargs`).
- Compared different collection types to understand when to use each one.

## Summary of Week 7

In this week, we studied **Sets and Dictionaries**, which are two important data structures in Python used for organizing data efficiently.  We learned that **sets** are unordered collections that only store unique values. Because of this, sets are very useful when duplicate data needs to be removed. We also explored several operations that sets support, such as finding common elements between sets or combining multiple sets into one. Additionally, we learned about **frozensets**, which are similar to sets but cannot be modified once created.The lecture then moved on to **dictionaries**, which store information in the form of key-value pairs. We learned that keys must be unique and cannot be changed, while values can be modified freely. Dictionaries are especially useful when data needs to be accessed quickly using a meaningful key. We practiced creating the dictionaries, modifying their contents, and looping through them in different ways.Towards the end of the lecture, we compared **lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries** to understand their strengths and weaknesses. This helped clarify which data structure is most suitable for different programming situations.

## Key Takeaways
- Sets automatically remove duplicate values
- Sets support powerful mathematical-style operations
- Set comprehensions provide a concise way to generate sets
- `frozenset` is an immutable version of a set
- Dictionaries store data using unique keys
- Dictionary values can be updated or removed
- Dictionaries can be passed into functions using `**kwargs`
- Each Python collection type has a specific use case
