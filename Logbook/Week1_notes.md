# Week 1 – Introduction to Programming

## Activities I Did
- Explored Python using the command-line interpreter.
- Practiced writing simple Python expressions.
- Experimented with arithmetic operators.
- Ran code interactively and observed outputs.
- Read and understood basic error messages.

## Summary of Week 1 Lecture
This week we learned the **Fundamentals of Computer Programming**. We explored what a computer program is and how programs take input, process data, and produce output. We were introduced to different generations of programming languages, from machine code to high-level languages.  The focus was on Python as a **third-generation programming language**, which supports interactive programming and is beginner-friendly. We also learned about expressions, operators, operator precedence, and common programming errors such as syntax and logical errors.
