# Week 3 – Control Statements

## Activities I Did
- Learned about Boolean expressions and how they return True or False.
- Practiced using `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements to control program flow.
- Used logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`) to combine multiple conditions.
- Explored membership operators `in` and `not in` for checking values in strings and lists.
- Applied the ternary operator for concise conditional assignments.
- Implemented loops using `while` and `for` statements.
- Controlled loops with `break` and `continue`.
- Practiced nested control statements for complex logic.

## Summary of Week 3 Lecture

This week focused on **Control Statements in Python**, which are used to **control program flow** by making decisions and repeating tasks.We learned about **Boolean expressions** that evaluate to **True or False** and are used in decision making. The lecture covered **conditional statements** such as **`if`**, **`elif`**, and **`else`**.We also studied **logical operators** (**`and`**, **`or`**, **`not`**) and **membership operators** (**`in`**, **`not in`**) to create complex conditions.Finally, we practiced **loops** using **`while`** and **`for`**, including loop control statements like **`break`**, **`continue`**, and **nested control statements**.


## Key Concepts Learned
- Boolean expressions and relational operators
- Conditional statements: `if`, `elif`, `else`
- Logical operators: `and`, `or`, `not`
- Membership operators: `in`, `not in`
- Ternary operator
