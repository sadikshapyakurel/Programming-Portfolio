# Week 8 – Input/Output and File Handling

## Activities I Did
- Understood how input, processing, and output work together in a program.
- Practiced improving program output using formatted strings.
- Used f-strings to display variables and expressions clearly.
- Tried formatting output using the `str.format()` method.
- Reviewed old %-style formatting to recognise it in existing programs.
- Learned how to work with files for storing and retrieving data.
- Opened files in different modes such as read, write, and append.
- Read data from files line by line and as a complete file.
- Wrote text and numeric data into files.
- Learned how file cursor position works.
- Used the `with` statement to safely manage file operations.

## Summary of Week 8 Lecture

This week’s lecture focused on **Input/Output (I/O)** and **File Handling** in Python.  
We discussed how every program follows the structure of taking input, processing it, and producing output. While simple programs can rely on `input()` and `print()`, real-world applications often require more advanced I/O techniques such as file handling.A major part of the lecture was about **formatting output** to make it more readable. We mainly worked with **f-strings**, which allow values and expressions to be inserted directly into strings. Other formatting techniques such as `str.format()` and the older %-style formatting were also introduced so that we can understand different coding styles.The lecture also covered **file handling**, where we learned how to open files, read data from them, and write information back to files. We explored different file modes and understood the difference between text and binary files. The idea of file position was theexplained using methods that allow moving within a file. Finally, we learned how to safely work with files using the **with statement**, which automatically closes files and helps prevent errors during file operations.
