# Week 2 – Variables and Types

## Activities I Did
- Learned how to store values using variables in Python.
- Practiced variable assignment and updating values.
- Used meaningful variable names following Python rules.
- Explored common data types such as `int`, `float`, `bool`, and `str`.
- Used built-in functions like `print()`, `input()`, `type()`, and `len()`.
- Took input from the user and converted data types when required.
- Practiced string operations such as concatenation, indexing, and slicing.
- Learned the difference between mutable lists and immutable strings.
- Worked with lists using indexing, slicing, and list mutation methods.

## Summary of Week 2 Lecture
This week we studied **variables and data types in Python**. Variables are used to store values so that they can be accessed and updated later in a program. A variable is identified using meaningful name called an identifier, which follows specific naming rules.We learned that Python uses**dynamic typing**, meaning the data type of a variable depends on the value most recently assigned to Common data types such as integers, floats, booleans, and strings were explored, and the `type()` function was used to check data types.The lecture also covered the use of **built-in functions** such a`print()` to display output and `input()` to get data from the user. We learned that input taken from the user is always returned as a string and may need to be converted to another data type.We studied **strings**, including the use of single, double, and triple quotes, escape sequences, indexing, negative indexing, and slicing to access parts of a string.Finally, we were introduced to**lists**, which are ordered collections of values. Unlike strings, lists are **mutable**, meaning their contents can be changed after creation. We practiced indexing, slicing, and mutating lists, and used the `len()` function to find the number of elements in a list.
