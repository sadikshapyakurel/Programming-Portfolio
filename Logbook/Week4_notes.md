# Week 4 – Functions

## Activities I Did
- Learned how to use built-in and external functions in Python.
- Practiced importing modules and specific functions using `import` and `from`.
- Explored defining my own functions using the `def` keyword.
- Used docstrings to describe the purpose of functions.
- Worked with functions that take parameters and return values.
- Practiced default and keyword arguments.
- Learned about variable length arguments using `*args`.
- Learned how arbitrary keyword arguments work using `**kwargs`.
- Explored lambda expressions for writing small anonymous functions.

## Summary of Week 4 Lecture

This week focused on **Functions in Python**, which help organize code and avoid repetition.  
We learned that Python provides many **built-in functions**, and additional functions can be accessed by **importing modules** from the Python Standard Library.We practiced **defining our own functions** using the `def` keyword and understood how **parameters and return values** work. The importance of **docstrings** was also discussed to document function behavior.The lecture is a introduced **default arguments** and **keyword arguments**, which make functions more flexible.  
We also learned about **variable length arguments (`*args`)** and **arbitrary keyword arguments (`**kwargs`)**, allowing functions to accept different numbers of inputs.Finally, we were     introduced to **lambda expressions**, which are small anonymous functions used for simple operations, especially when passed as arguments to other functions.
