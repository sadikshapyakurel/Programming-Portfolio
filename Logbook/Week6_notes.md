# Week 6 – Lists and Tuples

## Activities I Did
- Revised the list data type and how lists store ordered values.
- Practiced using indexing, slicing, and iteration with lists.
- Learned about list mutability and how list elements can be modified.
- Explored commonly used list methods such as `append()`, `extend()`, `insert()`, and `remove()`.
- Used the `del` statement to remove list elements and slices.
- Practiced creating lists using list comprehensions.
- Learned about tuples and how they differ from lists.
- Created tuples and accessed their elements using indexing and unpacking.
- Used tuples with function arguments, including `*args`.
- Compared the use cases of lists versus tuples.

## Summary of Week 6 Lecture

This week focused on **Lists and Tuples**, which are important sequence data types in Python.  
We revised **lists**, learning that they store ordered values and are **mutable**, meaning their contents can be changed. We explored several **list methods** that allow adding, removing, and rearranging elements.We also learned about **list comprehensions**, which provide a concise and readable way to create lists from existing sequences and conditions.The lecture then introduced **tuples**, which are similar to lists but **immutable**. Tuples are commonly used to store a small collection of related values, often of different data types. We practiced creating tuples,accessing elements through indexing and unpacking, and using tuples as **function arguments**.Finally, we compared **lists and tuples** and learned when each should be used in Python programs.

## Key Concepts Learned
- Lists as ordered and mutable sequences

- Removing elements using `del`
- List comprehensions
- Tuples and immutability
- Creating and accessing tuples
- Tuple packing and unpacking
- Tuples as function arguments (`*args`)
- Differences between lists and tuples
