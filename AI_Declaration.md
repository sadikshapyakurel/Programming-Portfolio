## AI Declaration

I want to openly acknowledge the role of AI as a virtual mentor throughout my learning journey. This intelligent assistant acted as a helpful guide to clarify concepts, brainstorm ideas, and provide support during my projects. Rather than spending countless hours solely with textbooks, I leveraged AI to gain insights and direction efficiently. I am fully committed to upholding academic honesty and understand the serious consequences of any form of misconduct. Therefore, AI was never used to blindly copy or submit work but solely as a tool to deepen my comprehension and enhance my skills.

## How AI Was Utilized

AI served as a valuable resource for quickly accessing useful shortcuts and commands, as well as for explaining complex questions without directly providing code. It helped me think through problems, break down challenges, and build a stronger foundation for writing my own Python programs. In essence, AI acted as a catalyst for better problem-solving and learning rather than a replacement for my own efforts.
