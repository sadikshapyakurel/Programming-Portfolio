Description:
This program asks the user to enter their name and then prints a friendly greeting message addressing the user by their name.

It does the following:
- Prompts the user for their name using input().
- Prints a personalized greeting using an f-string.

Key concepts used:
- User input (input())
- String formatting (f-strings)                                                                                                   

## Program 2: Celsius to Fahrenheit Converter

This program converts a temperature given in Celsius to Fahrenheit.

It does the following:
- Prompts the user to enter a temperature in Celsius.
- Converts the Celsius temperature to Fahrenheit using the formula:
    Fahrenheit = (Celsius * 9 / 5) + 32
- Prints the converted temperature in a formatted message.

Key concepts used:
- User input (input()) and type conversion to float
- Arithmetic operations
- String formatting (f-strings)
-
## Program 3: Grouping Students
Description:
This program calculates how many groups of students can be formed and how many students will be left over based on a specified group size.

It does the following:
- Asks the user for the total number of students.
- Asks for the desired group size.
- Calculates the number of complete groups using integer division (//).
- Calculates leftover students using the modulus operator (%).
- Prints the result with proper singular/plural handling for the leftover students.

Key concepts used:
- User input (input()) and type conversion to int
- Integer division and modulus operations
- Conditional expression for singular/plural word form
- String formatting (f-strings)

## Program 4: Distributing Sweets Among Pupils
Description:
This program calculates how many sweets each pupil will get and how many sweets will remain undistributed.

It does the following:
- Asks the user for the total number of sweets.
- Asks for the number of pupils present.
- Calculates how many sweets each pupil receives using integer division (//).
- Calculates leftover sweets using modulus operator (%).
- Prints the distribution with proper singular/plural word handling.

Key concepts used:
- User input (input()) and type conversion to int
- Integer division and modulus operations
- Conditional expression for singular/plural word form
- String formatting (f-strings)
