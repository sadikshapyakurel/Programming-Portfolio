week 4

## Program 1: Number Range Validation
This program checks whether a given number lies between 0 and 100 (inclusive).

It does the following:
- Takes a number as input from the user.
- Uses a function to validate the number range.
- Prints True if the number is valid, otherwise False.

Key concepts used:
- Functions
- Comparison operators
- Boolean return values
- User input and type conversion (int())

## Program 2: Count Uppercase and Lowercase Letters
This program returns the number of uppercase and lowercase letters in a given string.

It does the following:
- Accepts text input from the user.
- Counts uppercase and lowercase letters using a function.
- Displays the count separately.

Key concepts used:
- Functions
- String methods (isupper(), islower())
- Loops inside sum()
- Tuple return values

## Program 3: Properly Capitalised Greeting
This program greets the user with their name properly capitalised. If no name is entered, it greets the user as "Stranger".

It does the following:
- Takes the user’s name as input.
- Capitalises the first letter of the name.
- Handles empty input safely.

Key concepts used:
- Functions
- String manipulation (strip(), capitalize())
- Conditional expressions
- Formatted output (f-strings)

## Program 4: Remove Last Character from Text
This program removes the last character from a string if possible.

It does the following:
- Accepts text input from the user.
- Removes the last character only if the string length is greater than one.
- Prints the modified text.

Key concepts used:
- Functions
- String slicing
- Conditional logic
- User input handling

## Program 5: Celsius to Fahrenheit Conversion (25C Format)
This program converts a centigrade temperature entered in the format 25C into Fahrenheit.

It does the following:
- Reads temperature input ending with C.
- Extracts the numeric value from the string.
- Converts it to Fahrenheit and displays the result.

Key concepts used:
- Functions
- String slicing
- Type conversion (float)
- Arithmetic operations

## Program 6: Temperature Conversion Functions
This program converts temperatures between centigrade and fahrenheit using functions.

It does the following:
- Defines a function to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit.
- Defines a function to convert Fahrenheit to Celsius.
- Demonstrates conversions using fixed values.

Key concepts used:
- Functions
- Mathematical formulas
- Return values

## Program 7: Multiple Temperature Processing
This program processes any number of centigrade temperatures until the user presses Enter, then displays the maximum, minimum, and mean temperature.

It does the following:
- Continuously accepts temperature input from the user.
- Stops input when Enter is pressed.
- Calculates and prints max, min, and mean values.

Key concepts used:
- Functions
- While loop
- Lists
- Built-in functions (max(), min())
- statistics.mean

## Program 8: Fixed Temperature Statistics (6 Values)
This program reads six centigrade temperatures and displays their maximum, minimum, and mean.

It does the following:
- Uses a function to read temperature input.
- Stores six values using list comprehension.
- Calculates and displays statistics.

Key concepts used:
- Functions
- List comprehension
- Loops
- Built-in statistics functions
- User input handling
